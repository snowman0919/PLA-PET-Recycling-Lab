# 16 mm x 16 L/D screw/barrel 제조성 audit — RFQ 기준

## Controlling geometry

STEP은 3D 견적/간섭 기준, SVG와 본 문서는 치수·GD&T 기준이다. STL/DXF는 CAM reference이며 공차를 대체하지 않는다. 공급사는 임의로 clearance나 heat treatment를 변경하지 않는다.

## EX-SCR-01 screw

- SCM440, normalized blank → rough turn → QT 28–32 HRC → centres 유지.
- Total 316.0 ±0.10; active 256.0; single-start RH; pitch 16.00 ±0.03; flight land 1.60 ±0.05.
- Zone 8D/4D/4D. Root Ø10.88 feed, linear compression, Ø14.08 meter. Flight OD Ø15.92 -0.02/0.
- Drive Ø12 h6 x35 with KS/DIN 4 x4 key, shaft keyseat 4 P9 wide x2.5 +0.10/0 deep; thrust journal Ø15 h6 x20; shoulder face perpendicularity 0.03 to Datum A axis. Flight start angle is 0° ±5° from key centre plane at active-section start.
- 4-axis flight mill leaving 0.15 mm grind/polish allowance. Root/flank Ra≤1.6 µm, flight OD Ra≤0.8 µm.
- Gas nitride 0.30–0.50 mm effective case, surface 900–1100 HV; mask drive/thrust journals. Final flight-OD grind between centres.
- Flight OD TIR ≤0.05 over active 256; drive-to-flight concentricity ≤0.03; straightness ≤0.05/256. No weld repair.

## EX-BAR-01 barrel

- SCM440 solid/seamless blank, QT 28–32 HRC. OD Ø34.00 ±0.05, length 280.00 ±0.05.
- Bore after final hone Ø16.20 +0.02/0, Ra≤0.4–0.8 µm. Bore straightness ≤0.05/256 and concentricity to OD/register ≤0.05.
- Feed opening 18 axial x20, rear edge 12.0 from Datum B. Port edges R0.5; no sharp edge over screw flight.
- Front 4x M5 x0.8, thread depth 10 minimum, PCD28 at 45/135/225/315° from feed-port centre plane. Front face is Datum C and is perpendicular 0.03 to bore axis.
- Rough deep drill → stress relieve → semi-finish ream/hone leaving 0.05–0.08 mm → feed port/flange machine → gas nitride 0.30–0.50 mm, ≥900 HV → final hone. Effective case after final hone is ≥0.25 mm.
- Report bore at 20/140/260 mm and roundness ≤0.02 at each station. Front/rear face perpendicularity 0.03 to bore axis.

## Matched clearance and inspection

Specified drawing-limit diametral clearance is 0.28–0.32 mm and radial clearance is 0.14–0.16 mm. Supplier records screw OD and barrel ID at three stations at 20 ±2 °C and pairs parts inside that interval. Blue/air-gauge report, hardness/case-depth certificate, Ra trace and TIR inspection sheet are RFQ deliverables.

## DFM decision

SCM440 was selected over stainless for local availability, machinability and nitriding cost. PET-temperature metal compatibility is adequate for a research coupon, but corrosion/wear life is not certified. `EX-CPN-SCR` 3-pitch와 `EX-CPN-BAR` 60 mm process coupon만 먼저 견적·가공할 수 있다. Coupon의 치수·경도·case depth·Ra가 본 도면을 만족하고 공급사 DFM이 닫힌 뒤에도 Gate-3 cold proof 전 full screw/barrel 발주는 HOLD다. No physical result is claimed here.

Coupon controlling dimensions: EX-CPN-SCR L48.00 ±0.05, three RH pitches 16.00 ±0.03, OD/root/land와 열처리는 EX-SCR-01 feed zone과 동일하며 journal은 없다. EX-CPN-BAR L60.00 ±0.05, OD Ø34.00 ±0.05, final ID Ø16.20 +0.02/0, bore Ra/case는 EX-BAR-01과 동일하다. 두 coupon의 ends는 axis에 0.03 이내 수직이다.
